## Notable Outcomes

- **Text selection detection component complete:**

  - Supports desktop (mouseup), mobile (touchend), keyboard (shift+arrows)
  - Character offsets relative to content container for anchoring
- **Codex automated review proved valuable:**
  - Caught whitespace trimming mismatch (offsets vs trimmed text)
  - Identified element node edge case in offset calculation
  - Found selections ending outside container being missed
- **Refactored to simpler Range API approach:**
  - Replaced manual TreeWalker with `Range.toString().length`
  - Cleaner code, smaller bundle (1.56 kB)
- **Mobile testing deferred** to popup UI phase for visual feedback

## Blockers & Needs

## Next Week Focus
