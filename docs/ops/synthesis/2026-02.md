# Monthly Synthesis — February 2026

## Flow Summary

- **Total PRs merged:** 8 (4 feature, 1 chore, 3 ops/heartbeats)
- **Average PR lead time:** <1 day (median ~23 hours)
- **Issues closed:** 5
- **Deployment frequency:** Continuous (Netlify auto-deploy)
- **Change failure rate:** 0% (no reverts)

## What Compounded?

### Wins & Breakthroughs

- **Resonance backend pipeline complete** — Full path from user selection to persistent storage now works: popup UI → W3C annotation format → Netlify Function → GitHub Contents API. Issues #43, #44, #47, #48 all closed this month.
- **W3C Web Annotation format adopted (#44)** — Selection data stored as TextQuoteSelector with prefix/suffix context and deterministic SHA-256 passage IDs. Standards-based approach pays forward.
- **GitHub-as-database pattern (#48)** — Resonance data written to `data/resonance/` via Contents API, avoiding separate database infrastructure. Handles file creation and append-to-existing JSON arrays with Unicode-safe base64 encoding.
- **Serverless endpoint live (#47)** — Netlify Function validates payload structure, handles CORS, and uses v2 format (Web API Request/Response). Frontend stub replaced with real fetch call.

### Process Improvements

- **Consistent heartbeat cadence** — 3 heartbeats filed (Feb 2, 9, 23), providing clear weekly context for this synthesis
- **Codex/ChatGPT reviews** — Continued to catch edge cases (debounced selectionchange, selection deduplication, whitespace handling)
- **Zero WIP at week boundaries** — Board stayed clean throughout the month; work completed before new items promoted

## What Didn't Work?

### Failed Experiments

- **Two-week gap between heartbeats** — Feb 9 to Feb 23 had no heartbeat, coinciding with a lower-activity period. Rhythm broke when velocity dipped.

### Lessons Learned

- **Netlify Functions v2 format matters** — v1 `handler` pattern vs v2 `export default` with Web API Request/Response caused initial confusion. Documented in memory for future reference.
- **GitHub PAT scoping** — Token stored in Netlify env vars, scoped to `beaulm/on-balance` with Contents read/write. Minimal-privilege approach worked well.
- **Unicode-safe base64** — Standard `btoa`/`atob` breaks on Unicode; needed explicit encoding for GitHub Contents API payloads.

## Theme Analysis

### Dominant Patterns

- **Backend infrastructure month** — 3 of 4 feature PRs were backend/integration work (#44 W3C format, #47 Netlify Function, #48 GitHub persistence)
- **Phase 1 nearing completion** — 4 of 6 remaining Phase 1 issues closed; only visualization (#45, #46), hardening (#49), and testing (#50-#52) remain
- **Steady velocity** — 8 PRs merged matches January exactly, despite the two-week quiet period

### Content Evolution

- Module content stable (no changes this month)
- New content type emerging: `data/resonance/` JSON files as user-generated data
- No documentation gaps identified

## Flow Health Check

### Current State

- **WIP limits:** Healthy at 0-1 concurrent items; never exceeded 2-item limit
- **Board hygiene:** Clean — promoted items match what was completed
- **CI/build stability:** Green all month, no flaky builds

### Adjustments Needed

- **Resume weekly heartbeat cadence** — the two-week gap suggests scheduling reminders
- **Firefox Mobile bug (#63)** persists — workaround exists but should be triaged before user testing
- **Consider end-to-end testing setup (#50)** before Phase 1 wrap-up

## Next Month Bets

### Top 3 Focus Areas

1. **Resonance visualization (#45, #46)** — Warm glow highlights and count tooltips are the last UI features before Phase 1 is visually complete
2. **Hardening (#49)** — Rate limiting and error handling for the Netlify Function before any user exposure
3. **End-to-end deploy and test (#50, #51)** — Full system validation and pilot user testing to close out Phase 1

### Capacity Planning

- Expect 4-6 issues closed (finishing Phase 1 backlog)
- Main dependency: visualization design decisions (#45 warm glow approach)
- Phase 1 synthesis (#52) should follow once #50-#51 are complete
- Firefox Mobile bug (#63) may need attention before user testing (#51)

## Meta: This Synthesis

### What worked well in this review?

- GitHub CLI data (PRs, issues, lead times) provided solid quantitative picture
- Weekly heartbeats gave clear narrative thread through the month
- January synthesis "Next Month Bets" mapped well to actual outcomes (2 of 3 bets landed)

### Synthesis quality score (1-5)

- **Depth:** 4 — Clear understanding of the backend pipeline arc
- **Clarity:** 4 — Next steps well-defined (finish Phase 1 UI + testing)
- **Speed:** 5 — Data gathering automated, synthesis straightforward
