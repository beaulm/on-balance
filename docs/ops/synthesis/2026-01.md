# Monthly Synthesis — January 2026

## Flow Summary

- **Total PRs merged:** 8 (5 feature, 3 ops/heartbeats)
- **Average PR lead time:** <1 day (most merged same day)
- **Issues closed:** 5
- **Deployment frequency:** Continuous (Netlify auto-deploy)
- **Change failure rate:** 0% (no reverts)

## What Compounded?

### Wins & Breakthroughs

- **Site went from zero to production** - Initialized Astro, added MDX/React, deployed to onbalanceproject.com in ~2 weeks
- **Content collections with symlinks** - Elegant solution keeping source content in `content/` while Astro reads from `site/src/content/modules`
- **Codex automated reviews** - Caught 3 edge cases in text selection (#59) before merge: whitespace trimming, element node offsets, selections ending outside container
- **Deploy previews working** - Every PR gets a preview URL for testing, enabled mobile testing without local setup

### Process Improvements

- **Weekly heartbeats** - Consistent rhythm established (3 heartbeats this month)
- **Branch naming convention** - `<type>/<description>-<issue-number>` working well
- **Claude Code collaboration** - Effective pairing on React components and debugging

## What Didn't Work?

### Failed Experiments

- **Auto-focus on popup** - Had to remove because it clears browser text selection, preventing copy/paste
- Initial element node offset calculation was overly complex before simplifying to Range API

### Lessons Learned

- **Preserve user affordances** - Text selection is a core browser feature; don't break it for UX additions
- **Range API is powerful** - `range.toString().length` handles both text and element nodes cleanly
- **Right-click needs special handling** - Context menus require `e.button !== 0` checks

## Theme Analysis

### Dominant Patterns

- **Phase 1 foundation work** - All 5 closed issues were from the Phase 1 roadmap (#37)
- **React component development** - TextSelectionHandler, ResonancePopup, ResonanceWrapper
- **Accessibility considerations** - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape), touch targets (44px), ARIA labels

### Content Evolution

- Module content stable (no changes this month)
- Focus entirely on reading experience infrastructure
- First interactive feature (resonance) taking shape

## Flow Health Check

### Current State

- **WIP limits:** Healthy at 1-2 concurrent items
- **Board hygiene:** Clean - issues well-organized with Phase 1 labels
- **CI/build stability:** Solid - Astro builds fast (~1.5s), no flaky tests

### Adjustments Needed

- Consider adding visual regression testing once UI stabilizes
- Mobile testing still relies on deploy previews - could formalize process

## Next Month Bets

### Top 3 Focus Areas

1. **Complete Resonance UI (#43-#46)** - Popup merged, then visualization and tooltips
2. **Backend persistence (#47-#48)** - Netlify Functions + GitHub API for storing resonance data
3. **End-to-end testing (#50)** - Full system validation before user testing

### Capacity Planning

- Expect 4-6 issues closed
- Main dependency: GitHub API integration for persistence
- May need to revisit W3C annotation format for storage (#44)

## Meta: This Synthesis

### What worked well in this review?

- PR/issue data from GitHub CLI was comprehensive
- Heartbeats provided good weekly context
- Clear Phase 1 structure made progress easy to track

### Synthesis quality score (1-5)

- **Depth:** 4 - Good understanding, first synthesis so baseline being established
- **Clarity:** 4 - Next steps clear (continue Phase 1 roadmap)
- **Speed:** 5 - ~15 minutes with data gathering
