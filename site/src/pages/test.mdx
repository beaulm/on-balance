# Attention as Lever

## The Foundation: What You Feed Grows

I thought I was present. I'm generally intentional, I meditate daily, practice mindfulness, track my energy, and monitor my alignment — or at least I go through phases of those things.

Then I started paying attention to my attention and discovered something startling: I was thinking constantly. Not just productive thinking — loops, rehearsals, grudges. My mind was consuming itself like an ouroboros, thinking about thinking about thinking.

There's a principle here, something fundamental: **Attention is pattern amplification.** To attend is to bring certain patterns into the foreground, to emphasize their presence relative to background noise. Attention isn't just noticing — it's sculpting the shape of reality by deciding what stands out and what fades back.

Whatever you attend to literally becomes more real. Not metaphorically — neurologically. Your brain strengthens the pathways you use most. Feed anxiety, grow anxiety. Feed wonder, grow wonder.
