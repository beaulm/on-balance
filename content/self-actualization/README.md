# Self-Actualization for the 21st Century

Practical modules for navigating uncertainty with agency and care.

## Philosophy

Under uncertainty, we can't control outcomes, but we can choose our responses. These modules focus on building capacity for wise action when the path isn't clear.

## Available Modules

- **[03 - Attention as Lever](./03-attention-as-lever/)**: Attention funds reality. Spend it where care can compound.

## Getting Started

Each module includes:
- Core concepts and practices
- 7-day MVP implementation
- Worksheets and reflection prompts
- Evidence collection (optional, anonymous)

Start with any module that resonates. They're designed to work independently or as a sequence.

## Format

All modules export to PDF/EPUB for offline use. See the main [README](../../README.md) for build instructions.
