# **Attention as Lever \- Practice Worksheet**

*Companion guide for the 7-day attention experiment*

## **Quick Start Guide**

**Too busy to read everything?** Here's the minimum viable practice:

1. **Pick your \#1 attention thief** (internal or external)  
2. Choose **one container** for the next 24 hours:  
   1. **Fence (restriction):** e.g., *no phone at meals*, *no computer 9–11pm*.  
   2. **Inverse fence (seeding):** e.g., *10–20 min meditation*, *silent walk*, *3 mindful breaths on the hour*.  
3. **When you notice the urge**, take 3 breaths  
4. **End of day**: Rate yourself 1-5 on "Did I notice my patterns today?"

That's it. Everything else is optional enhancement. **Success \= noticing**, not perfection.

## **Finding Your Drains**

Your attention drains won't be mine. Here are some lenses to look at where your attention goes:

### **The Death Bed Test**

What would you regret not attending to? For me: helping others, creating meaning, genuine presence with loved ones.

### **The Social Proof Test**

If no one else cared about it, would you? This single question can cut through half your drains on its own.

### **The Energy Audit**

What gives versus takes energy? Even hard things energize when aligned. Even easy things drain when misaligned.

### **The Childhood Test**

What captured your attention before the world told you what should? Often reveals core values.

### **Internal vs External**

Name which kind they are:

* **External drains:** phone, news, gossip, shopping, streaming, endless tabs.  
* **Internal drains:** songs on loop, rumination, argument rehearsal, compulsive planning, “micro‑checking” (email, weather, todos you already know).

---

## **Pre-Experiment: Drain Detection**

### **Identifying Your Attention Patterns \- Finding Your Unique Drains**

Before you begin, spend 5-10 minutes with this deeper discovery process:

**The Drain Detection Process:**

**1\. The Time Audit** (What disappears your time?) Think about yesterday. Where did unexpected time go?

* Morning: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Afternoon: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Evening: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* "Just 5 minutes" that became an hour: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**2\. The Mood Check** (What leaves you depleted?) After which activities do you feel:

* Anxious or activated: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Numb or disconnected: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Guilty or regretful: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Tired but not satisfied: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3\. The Excuse Patterns** (What do you defend?) Complete these sentences:

* "I need to check \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"  
* "I'm not addicted to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I can stop anytime"  
* "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ helps me relax" (but does it really?)  
* "Everyone does \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" (but do you want to?)

**4\. The Body Scan** (Where does tension live?) When you can't access your usual drain, what happens:

* Twitchy fingers? (Often indicates digital addiction)  
* Tight chest? (Often indicates anxiety loops)  
* Restless legs? (Often indicates action addiction)  
* Foggy head? (Often indicates mental loops)

**Common Attention Leaks:**

* [ ] Social media scrolling  
* [ ] News/doom scrolling
* [ ] Mental loops/rumination
* [ ] Checking email/messages repeatedly  
* [ ] Work thoughts during personal time  
* [ ] Personal drama during work time  
* [ ] Shopping/browsing you don't need  
* [ ] Checking stats/numbers/prices
* [ ] Overthinking past conversations  
* [ ] Planning conversations that won't happen  
* [ ] Songs stuck on repeat  
* [ ] Video/streaming "one more episode"  
* [ ] Gaming "one more round"
* [ ] Productivity porn (reading about vs doing)
* [ ] Actual porn
* [ ] Comparison/stalking specific people online
* [ ] Argument rehearsal in your mind
* [ ] Other:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Paradox Check:**

What do you do to "rest" that leaves you more tired? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What do you do to "connect" that leaves you lonelier? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What do you do to "help" that creates more work? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Your \#1 Drain** (Be specific): Not just "social media" but "Instagram exploring page at night" Not just "thinking" but "rehearsing arguments with my ex" Not just "news" but "refreshing election coverage every hour"

My specific \#1 drain: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**When does it hook you most?**

* Trigger situations: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Emotional states: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Times of day: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Environmental cues: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What would you do with reclaimed attention?** (This is your North Star \- keep it simple and specific)

## **The 7-Day Practice Framework**

### **Day 1-2: Awareness Only**

**Morning Intention (30 seconds):** "Today I'm just noticing where my attention goes, without judgment."

**Three Check-in Moments:**

* **Morning**: What am I feeding right now?  
* **Midday**: Where has my attention been?  
* **Evening**: What surprised me today?

**Evening Reflection (2 minutes):**

* My top 3 attention destinations today:  
  1. ---

  2. ---

  3. ---

* Surprised? Yes/No \- Why? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Tomorrow I'm curious about: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### **Days 3-5: Gentle Fences**

**Choose Your Fence Type:**

**Option A: Time-Based** (easiest)

* 15 minutes in morning without \[your leak\]  
* When urge arises: 3 breaths

**Option B: Transition-Based**

* No \[leak\] during transitions (walking, waiting, bathroom)  
* These natural pauses become conscious

**Option C: Container-Based**

* \[Leak\] only in designated space/time  
* E.g. news only at kitchen table, 5-10pm

**Option D: Inverse-Fence**

* Strengthen reliance against \[leak\]  
* E.g. 20‑min meditation, silent tea ritual, walk without audio for 10 min

**Daily Tracker:**

Day 3: Fenced? Y/N | Noticed urges: \_\_\_ times | Feeling: \_\_\_/5  
Day 4: Fenced? Y/N | Noticed urges: \_\_\_ times | Feeling: \_\_\_/5  
Day 5: Fenced? Y/N | Noticed urges: \_\_\_ times | Feeling: \_\_\_/5

### **Days 6-7: Conscious Choice**

**Add Second Fence \+ One Small Step**

**Morning Fence**: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ minutes without \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Evening Fence**: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ minutes without \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The One Small Step \- Finding What You Want to Feed**

When you stop feeding your attention leaks, space opens up. But for what? This is about discovering what you actually want to grow, not what you think you should want.

**Quick Discovery Process (5 minutes):**

Ask yourself these questions and notice what arises (first thought, best thought):

1. **The Deathbed Test**: What would you regret not doing/creating/saying?  

---

2. **The Energy Test**: What activities make you lose track of time in a good way?  

---

3. **The Jealousy Test**: What do you see others doing that sparks envy (envy points to desire)?  

---

4. **The Child Test**: What did you love doing before the world told you it wasn't practical?  

---

5. **The Helper Test**: What do people ask you for help with that you actually enjoy giving?  

---

**Common Meaningful Directions:**

**Creating Something**

* Open the document (writing)  
* Pick up the instrument (music)  
* Sketch one thing (art)  
* Code for 5 minutes (project)  
* Cook one new recipe (culinary)

**Connecting Deeply**

* Text that friend you miss  
* Write one thank you note  
* Have one undistracted conversation  
* Play with kids/pets presently  
* Call someone who matters

**Moving Your Body**

* Put on exercise clothes  
* Step outside for air  
* Do one stretch  
* Dance to one song  
* Walk around the block

**Learning/Growing**

* Read one page of that book  
* Watch 5 min of tutorial  
* Practice one phrase (language)  
* Try one new technique  
* Ask one curious question

**Tending/Caring**

* Water one plant  
* Clear one surface  
* Fix one small thing  
* Organize one drawer  
* Care for one neglected area

**The Key: Make It Laughably Small**

If "write chapter" feels heavy → "open document"

If "exercise" feels huge → "put on shoes"

If "learn Spanish" feels impossible → "one word"

If "start business" feels overwhelming → "write one idea"

If "reconnect with friend" feels awkward → "like their post"

The step isn't the achievement. It's the bridge. Once you've opened the document, you might write. Once you've put on shoes, you might walk. But even if you don't, you've strengthened the neural pathway toward what matters to you.

**Finding YOUR Step:**

Look at your answers above. What's the tiniest possible step toward one of them? My one small step: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Remember:

* It should take less than 60 seconds  
* It should feel almost silly how small it is  
* Success \= doing the tiny step, not what comes after  
* Same step all week or different each day \- both work  
* If it feels like effort, make it smaller

**Integration Questions:**

* What's emerging in the cleared space? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* What state am I in when I fence successfully? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* What bridges help me redirect? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* What do I actually want to feed with my attention? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## **Adaptation Guides**

### **For Different Neurotypes**

**ADHD Adaptations:**

* Shorter fences (3-5 minutes)  
* Visual timers (not phone)  
* Body doubling (do it with someone)  
* Fidget/movement allowed during fences  
* Celebrate noticing, not perfect redirecting  
* Use transitions as natural fences

**Autism Adaptations:**

* Use routine as scaffold (same time daily)  
* Clear parameters (exactly what's included/excluded)  
* Stim-friendly redirects  
* Track patterns in preferred format  
* Honor sensory needs during practice

**Anxiety Adaptations:**

* Start micro (2-minute fences)  
* Keep phone nearby but face-down  
* Pair with grounding (5-4-3-2-1 sensory)  
* "I'm safe" reminder before fencing  
* Lower stakes (curious not corrective)  
* Always have an out

### **For Different Life Contexts**

**Parenting:**

* Fence during kids' screen time

## **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Challenges & Solutions**

**"I keep forgetting"**

* Set 3 gentle phone alarms  
* Post-it notes in key spots  
* Pair with existing habit (coffee, brushing teeth)  
* Tell someone (accountability)  
* Lower the bar (forgetting is data too)

**"15 minutes feels impossible"**

* Start with 2 minutes  
* Build by 1 minute every 2 days  
* Multiple micro-fences instead of one long  
* Success \= any conscious choice  
* Some days will be harder

**"I feel anxious without my phone/news/etc"**

* Keep it nearby but create friction  
* Face-down, across room, logged out  
* Note the anxiety (it's information)  
* Breathe through it (it will pass)  
* Have a backup activity ready

**"Nothing's changing"**

* Change takes time (trust the process)  
* Look for subtle shifts (noticed faster? caught earlier?)  
* You're building awareness muscle  
* Try different fence times/types  
* Success isn't perfection

**"I'm thinking about the fence all day"**

* You're over-efforting  
* Set fence times and forget between  
* This is practice, not performance  
* Lower your fence time  
* Add self-compassion

* Diffuse (open awareness)  
* Meta (attention on attention)  
* Flow (absorbed)  
* Scattered (multiple streams)

### **Level 4: Collective Patterns**

Notice how your attention affects others:

* Do people relax when you fence?  
* Does conversation quality change?  
* Do your kids behave differently?  
* Does work feel different?

  * Their emerging insight  
* No advice, just witnessing

**Week 3: Collective Experiment**

* Choose one shared fence time  
* Everyone fences simultaneously (different leaks)  
* Notice the collective field shift

**Week 4: Integration**

* What patterns do we share?  
* How do our attention patterns interact?
