## Why this matters
Attention is a currency and a steering wheel. What we attend to grows in salience and influence. Under uncertainty, deliberately choosing **what to feed** is how we retain agency without pretending we control outcomes.

### Key ideas
- **Budget, then buy.** Treat attention like scarce time/energy.
- **Pace vs. humanity.** Faster inputs shorten patience and squeeze compassion.
- **Friction is a feature.** Add tiny obstacles to low-value loops; reduce friction for high-value acts.
- **Social proof ≠ truth.** Independence of judgment protects your attention commons.

## MVP — 10 minutes/day × 7 days
**Goal:** Reallocate 30–60 minutes/day from low-value loops to life-giving actions.

**Daily steps (≤10 min)**
1. Two no-scroll blocks (15–30 min). Phone away.
2. 1-minute Head/Heart/Gut check.
3. One deliberate click: begin the highest-value action.

**Weekly steps (15–20 min)**
- Do the **Attention Audit** once.
- Pick **two friction edits** (add friction to low-value; remove friction for high-value).

**Safety / opt-outs**
- If anxiety spikes, shorten blocks to 5 min + 3 slow breaths.
- If your device is safety-critical, set whitelist exceptions.

## 7-Day Attention Audit
Track one ordinary day, then summarize.

1) **Inputs inventory** (top 10 inputs last 48h). Mark Energy (+2…-2), Integrity (Y/N), Friction (Easy/Med/Hard).  
2) **Time slices** (estimate hours per input).  
3) **Reallocate** two downshifts (−15–30 min) and one upshift (+30–60 min).  
4) **Commit**: “I won’t feed ___ from ___ to ___.” / “I will feed ___ right after ___.”  
5) **Measure** nightly: Integrity, Clarity, Care, Recovery (1–5) + one sentence insight.

## Printable — 1-Page Practice Card
Choose What to Feed
- Two no-scroll blocks (15–30 min)
- 3 breaths + 1-min H/H/G check
- One deliberate click → highest-value action
- Friction edits: +friction low-value; −friction high-value
- Evening pulse: Integrity / Clarity / Care / Recovery (1–5)

## Evidence (optional, anonymous)
- Baseline vs. Day 7 averages on the four pulses.
- Free-text: “Where did saved minutes go?” “One surprising barrier?”

## FAQ
**Q:** Is this productivity cosplay?  
**A:** No. The north star is humane presence. The aim is space where care can compound.
